Conditional Entropy Network Inference 

Paths: must modify local paths at the top of infer_network.py to use

Usage: python infer_network.py

Output: command line information + png of final network

Main Parameters: 
- modify them manually in infer_network.py, not command line
- dataset: 
	- primary project was with 'hema' 
	- also exist binary problems such as '5AND' and benchmarks such as 'lizards'
	- see data.py for more options
- G:
	- instead of starting from a complete graph, can use a pre-built networkx graph 
- thresh_mult:
	- cheap way to modify the threshold with which remove edges 
	- not used in final report since varies too much with different datasets
